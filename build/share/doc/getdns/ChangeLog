* 2015-04-19: Version 0.1.8
  * The GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS_ONLY_KEEP_CONNECTIONS_OPEN and
    GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS_FIRST_AND_FALL_BACK_TO_TCP_KEEP_CONNECTIONS_OPEN
    DNS over TLS transport options. 

* 2015-04-08: Version 0.1.7
  * Individual getter functions for context settings
  * Fix: --with-current-date function to make build deterministically
    reproducible (i.e. the GETDNS_COMPILATION_COMMENT define from
    getdns.h contains a date value).  Thanks Ondřej Surý
  * Fix: Include m4 dir in distribution tarball
  * Fix: Link build requirements in tests too.  Thanks Ondřej Surý
  * Fix: Remove executable flags on source files.  Thanks Paul Wouters
  * Fix: Return "just_address_answers" only when queried for addresses
  * Eliminate ldns intermediate wireformat parsing
  * The CSYNC RR type
  * Fix: canonical_name in response dict returns the canonical name
    found after following all CNAMEs
  * Implementation of the section 6 and 7 version of 
    draft-ietf-dnsop-cookies-01.txt for stub resolution.  Enable with the
    --enable-draft-edns-cookies option to configure.  Use it by setting the
    edns_cookies extension to GETDNS_EXTENSION_TRUE.
  * Pretty printing of lists with:
    char *getdns_pretty_print_list(getdns_list *list)
  * Output to json format with:
    char * getdns_print_json_dict(const getdns_dict *some_dict, int pretty);
    char * getdns_print_json_list(const getdns_list *some_list, int pretty);
  * snprintf style versions of the dict, list and json print functions.
  * Better random number generation with OpenBSD's arc4random
  * Let getdns_address schedule the AAAA query first.  This results in AAAA
    being the first in the just_address_answers sections of the response dict.
  * New context update callback function to also return a user given argument
    along with the context and which item was changed.
    Thanks Scott Hollenbeck.
  * Demotivate use of getdns_strerror and expose getdns_get_errorstr_by_id.
    Thanks Scott Hollenbeck.
  * A getter for context update callback, to allow for chaining update
    callbacks.

* 2015-01-16: Version 0.1.6
  * Fix: linking against libev on FreeBSD
  * Fix: Let configure report problem on FreeBSD when configuring with
    libevent and libunbound <= 1.4.22 is not compiled with libevent.
  * Fix: Build on Mac OS-X
  * Fix: Lintian errors in manpages
  * Better libcheck detection
  * Better portability with UNIX systems

* 2014-10-31: Version 0.1.5
  * Unit tests for transport settings
  * Fix: adhere to set maximum UDP payload size
  * API change: when no maximum UDP payload size is set, outgoing
    values will adhere to the suggestions in RFC 6891 and may follow
    a scheme that uses multiple values to maximize receptivity.
  * Stub mode use 1232 maximum UDP payload size when connecting to an
    IPv6 upstreams and 1432 with an IPv4 upstream.
  * Evaluate namespaces (or not) on a per query basis
  * GETDNS_NAMESPACE_LOCALNAMES namespace now gives just_address_answers
    only and does not mimic a DNS packet answer anymore
  * The add_opt_parameters extension
  * IPv6 scope_id support with link-local addresses.  Both with parsing
    /etc/resolv.conf and by providing them explicitly via
    getdns_context_set_upstream_recursive_servers
  * Query for A and AAAA simultaneously with return_both_v4_and_v6
  * GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TCP_ONLY_KEEP_CONNECTIONS_OPEN DNS transport
  * Fix: Answers without RRs in query secion (i.e. REFUSED)
  * Fix: Return empty response dict on timeout in async mode too
  * Move spec examples to spec subdirectory
  * Fix issue#76: Setting UDP Payload size below 512 should not error
  * Fix: Include OPT RR in response dict always (even without options)
  * TCP Fast open support (linux only).
    Enable with the --enable-tcp-fastopen configure option
  * Bump library version because of binary API change

* 2014-09-03: Version 0.1.4
  * Synchronous resolves now respect timeout setting,
  * On timeout *_sync functions now return GETDNS_RETURN_GOOD and a
    response dict with "status" GETDNS_RESPSTATUS_ALL_TIMEOUT>
  * Fix issue#50: getdns_dict_remove_name returns GETDNS_RETURN_GOOD on
    success.
  * Fix Issue#54: set_ub_dns_transport() not working
  * Fix Issue#49: Typo in documentation (thanks Stephane Bortzmeyer)
  * getdns_context_set_limit_outstanding_queries(),
    getdns_context_set_dnssec_allowed_skew() and
    getdns_context_set_edns_maximum_udp_payload_size() now working
  * <rr>_unknown rdata field for unknown or unsupported RR types
  * Temporarily disable timeout unit test 3 because of unpredictable results
  * Spec updated to version 0.507
  * Renamed "resolver_type" to "resolution_type" in dict returned from
    getdns_context_get_api_information()
  * Added GETDNS_RESPSTATUS_ALL_BOGUS_ANSWERS return code for with the
    dnssec_return_only_secure extension
  * Added support for CDS and CDNSKEY RR types, but needs ldns > 1.6.17 to
    be able to parse the wire format (not released yet at time of writing)
  * Added OPENPGPKEY RR type, but no rdata fields implementation yet
  * Updated spec to version 0.508 (September 2014)
  * Also chase NSEC and NSEC3 RRSIGs with dnssec_return_validation_chain

* 2014-06-25: Version 0.1.3

  * Update specification to the June 2014 version (0.501)

* 2014-06-02: Version 0.1.2
  * Fixed rdata fields for MX
  * Expose only public API symbols
  * Updated manpages
  * specify_class extension
  * Build from separate build directory
  * Anticipate libunbound not returning the answer packet
  * Pretty print bindata's representing IP addresses
  * Anticipate absense of implicit DSO linking
  * Mention getdns specific options to configure in INSTALL
    Thanks Paul Hoffman
  * Mac OSX package built instructions for generic user in README.md
    Thanks Joel Purra
  * Fixed build problems on RHEL/CentOS due using libevent 1.x


* 2014-03-24 : Version 0.1.1
  * default to NOT build extensions (libev, libuv, libevent), handle
    --with/--without options to configure for them

  * respect configure --docdir=X
  * Documentation/man page updates
  * Fix install and cpp guards in getdns_extra.h
